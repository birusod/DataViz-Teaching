# A Chart of Charts

An interactive chart that I use in DataViz workshops. Participants fill a circle in case they have used a certain chart type. The emerging dot plot allows to explore the most and less frequently used types and the variety among chart types and participants.

The "Visualization Universe" was created by [Anna Vital](http://anna.vc/) and [Mark Vital](http://fundersandfounders.com/author/mark-vital/) from [Adioma](http://www.labs.adioma.com/) and [Alexander Vushkan](https://www.alexzender.com/) with the assistance of the [Google News Lab](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/training/): [Simon Rogers](https://www.simonrogers.net/) and [Alberto Cairo](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/) for art direction - thank you!
Please note that I removed and aggregated some of the chart types. For a full list have a look at the wonderful [visualizationuniverse homepage](http://visualizationuniverse.com/charts/?sortBy=volume&sortDir=desc).
